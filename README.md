## ðŸ§¾ Case 1: AI Resume Screening Tool

**Whatâ€™s happening**  
A company uses an AI-driven system to screen and rank resumes. It shortlists candidates based on keyword matching and past hiring data.

**Whatâ€™s problematic**  
The AI inherits biases from previous hiring patterns, disproportionately filtering out candidates from underrepresented groups, lesser-known universities, or non-traditional backgrounds.

**One improvement idea**  
Retrain the AI model on a more diverse and inclusive dataset. Include regular fairness audits to ensure the tool promotes equal opportunity regardless of gender, ethnicity, or educational background.

## ðŸ§¾ Case 2: Facial Recognition in Public Spaces

**Whatâ€™s happening**  
Facial recognition cameras are deployed in public spaces by city authorities to enhance surveillance and public safety.

**Whatâ€™s problematic**  
The technology shows higher error rates for people from minority ethnic groups, potentially leading to misidentification, privacy infringements, and unjust consequences.

**One improvement idea**  
Introduce legislation requiring transparency, human oversight, and independent third-party audits before deployment. Ensure that use cases are justified and proportionate.
